For this project, I used the Jupiter notebook for analysing data which contained most updated version of Python.

## Dataset Access

For this data analysis, I used publicly available data of Airbnb Boston at kaggle.com. This data was available in form of three CSV files: 
* calendar.csv
* listings.csv
* reviews.csv

## Motivation for Project

I wanted to learn about the factors which affect the Airbnb prices across a same city. Then using data analalysis, I wanted to answer the following questions:
* Which is the most popular region to stay in Boston?
* What is the price distribution in the city and which region is the most expensive?
* What are some of the factors deciding the rent of place?

## Data Preparation

The dataset obtaned from kaggle.com had 3585 observations and 95 features about the listings. I only needed few features for this data analysis, so I did data wrangling and data cleaning to filter the data needed for this project.
Some of the examples of data cleaning include converting prices from string to float format, removing commas and $ signs. I had to take care of missing data. I dropped the extra data that wasn't required for my study.
